# Number_Convertor in C++
This is an convertor from decimal value to hexadecimal, octal and binary.
Here I try to improve my skills in C++ and try to learn Git.
If you have any comments about the code, please tell me what is wrong and I will try to rewrite the code and learn something new from your tips.
